🌱 The Good Deed Beanstalk

A whimsical, Ghibli-style React application that visualizes your daily good deeds as a growing beanstalk. As you log acts of kindness, productivity, or charity, your stalk grows higher into the sky, unlocking a lush, animated environment.

✨ Features

Infinite Growth: The beanstalk grows procedurally based on your total deed points.

Deed Analysis: Automatic keyword detection categorizes deeds (Kindness, Productivity, Charity, Self Care) and assigns points.

Streak System: Keeps track of consecutive days with a fiery streak indicator.

Ghibli-Inspired Aesthetic: Features floating clouds, swaying vines, and a painted sky gradient using CSS animations and Tailwind.

Data Persistence: Uses localStorage so your progress is saved between sessions.
